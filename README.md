Objective of the Project:
 The objective of this project is to create a simple grading system where a user inputs the marks for five subjects, and the program calculates the average and determines the corresponding grade based on predefined thresholds.
Outcome: The outcome is a program that can assist teachers or students in quickly calculating grades based on the average marks.
Key Activities of the Project:
Input Collection: Collect marks from the user for five different subjects.
Average Calculation: Compute the average of the collected marks.
Grade Determination: Compare the average against defined grade thresholds and determine the corresponding grade.
